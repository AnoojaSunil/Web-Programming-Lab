<h3><b><u>The situation that lead to stress and how I handled it</u></b></h3>
<p><i><b>I booked seat for MCA in a college and after some months they asked me to pay the remaining fees immediately and said that otherwise my admission will be cancelled.At that time the ranklist was not published so that I asked them time for the ranklist to come because I want to study in Government/aided college.But they don't give me the time and my admission in that college was cancelled.So I was so tensed whether I get an admission in a Government/aided college.This was a situation recently that lead me to stress  and I handled it with the support of my family and friends and their prayers,I got admission in MA college</b></i></p>
